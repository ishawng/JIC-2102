# Korean Language Game
A react app created to gamify the learning of KOR 1001 at Georgia Tech. The app will include vocabulary flashcards for each unit of KOR 1001, as well as Squid Game inspired learning minigames.

# Release Notes

## Version 0.4.0

### New Features
Our goal for the fourth sprint was to have a playable and nearly finalized version of the minigames. Both games have updated art, animations, game modes, and UI, and all new updates to the games are successfully working.
* Answer Language settings added to both the Red Light Green Light and the Tug of War minigames. The answer language corresponds to which language the user wants to answer the question in.
* Working animations for both minigames.
* Play again option added for both minigames. The play again option allows the user to reset the game settings, which are the difficulty level and answer language settings, and then replay the game. 

### Bug Fixes
* Fixed issue with Red Light Green Light UI where the question div would move depending on the length of the question.

## Version 0.3.0

### New Features
Our goal for the third sprint was to incorporate grammar questions into our learning minigames, as well as add difficulty levels to the Red Light Green Light minigame.
* Easy, Medium, and Hard difficulty level settings added to Red Light Green Light minigame. The difficulty choice corresponds to how long the user has to answer a question before the light turns red.
* Option to play the Red Light Green Light minigame in grammar question mode.
* Option to play the Tug of War minigame in grammar mode.

### Bug Fixes
* Fixed issue with Red Light Green Light minigame where a user not answering a question resulted in the loss of multiple lives.

### Known Issues
* The light does not change to red when a user incorrectly answers a question in the Red Light Green Light minigame.

## Version 0.2.0
