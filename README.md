# Korean Language Game
A react app created to gamify the learning of KOR 1001 at Georgia Tech. The app will include vocabulary flashcards for each unit of KOR 1001, as well as Squid Game inspired learning minigames.

# Release Notes

## Version 0.1.0

### New Features
Our goal for this first sprint was to learn react and to create the basic pages and navigation flow for our web app.
* Home page with "PLAY" button to transition to a list of the KOR 1001 course units.
* Units page with buttons for each KOR 1001 unit.
* Study option pages for each unit with buttons to access vocab, the red light green light minigame, and the tug of war minigame.
* A mostly blank vocab page for each unit (to be implemented later).
* A mostly blank red light green light minigame page (to be implemented later).
* A mostly blank tug of war minigame page (to be implemented later).
* A mostly blank About page (to be implemented later).
* A navigation bar on every page to navigate to the Home, Units, and About pages.
